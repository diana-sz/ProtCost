To reproduce the results run:
predict_parameters.R - predict kcats and KMs (after running this, the model file needs to be manually updated)
run_GBA.R - run GBA with given parameters
plot_validation.R - plot R/P ratio and biomass composition
test_protein_cost_parallel.R - vary each protein and predict growth rate
